Commands		Number of commands handled 	 	Command name

echo 				    2				  -n,  -E
pwd				    2 				     
cd				    1				    -P
mkdir				    2				  -p,  -v
cat				    2				  -n,  -E
date 				    2 				  -u,  -R
rm 				    2				  -i,  -v
ls				    2 				  -A,  -r

Assumptions:
	   1) I have taken only one file input for cat command.
	   2) no extra spaces between input like "lv  sdf" only like this "df vs".

Invalid input has been handled in my code.
